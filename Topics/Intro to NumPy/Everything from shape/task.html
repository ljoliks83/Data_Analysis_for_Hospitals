<p></p><p>The only thing you know about a NumPy array <code class="language-python">a</code> is its <strong><u>shape</u></strong>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(a.shape)  # (3, 2, 6, 1)</code></pre><p>Can you infer the following from <code class="language-python">a.shape</code>:</p><ul><li><p>array's <u>number of dimensions</u>?</p></li><li><p>array's <u>size</u>?</p></li><li><p>the <u>number of elements</u> in the first dimension?</p></li></ul><p>Sum the numerical values of the features that can be inferred from <code class="language-python">a.shape</code> . If the feature can't be inferred, do not add anything to the score. The answer is the sum described above.</p><p>For example, <em>hypothetically</em>, let's say we can get the number of dimensions from <code class="language-python">a.shape</code>, and it's 3; we can't infer the size from <code class="language-python">a.shape</code>; and the number of elements in the first dimension is 5. Then, the answer would be <span class="math-tex">\(3+5 = 8\)</span>.</p><p>If you are not sure about the answer, revise the information from the "Learning sizes" part of the theory (especially the paragraph that starts with <em>To drive the point home...</em>). You can also consider the following snippet to obtain the answer:</p><pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

n = np.zeros((3, 2, 6, 1))</code></pre>
