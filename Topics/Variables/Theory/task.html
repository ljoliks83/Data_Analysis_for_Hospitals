<p>You can use a programming language like Python to do calculations or work with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a constant is a type of variable that, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned. | However, Python does not have built-in support for constants, and variable names are not enforced to be constant. Instead, programmers use naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. In the context of the provided text, the discussion revolves around two specific constants, `inf` and `-inf`, which represent positive and negative infinity, respectively. These constants are part of the floating-point arithmetic system and follow the same rules as other floating-point numbers. They can be used in arithmetic operations, and their use can optimize algorithms and find the lowest and highest values in a list of values.">constant</a> values like strings. Is this enough for you, though? When writing real programs, you usually need to <strong>store values</strong> or <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, evaluation refers to the process of determining the result of an expression or a condition. | After evaluation, we are left with a resulting value. This is important in the context of logical operations, where you deal with so-called truthy and falsy values. Although Python has a boolean data type, you can use non-boolean values in a logical context. When used with logical operators, values of non-boolean types, such as integers or strings, are called truthy or falsy, depending on whether they are interpreted as true or false. For instance, the following values are evaluated as false in Python: `None`, `0`, `0.0`, `[]`, `{}`, and `''`. Evaluation order and operator precedence are crucial when working with logical expressions. For example, consider the expression `1 &lt; x &lt; 3`. This is evaluated as `(1 &lt; x) &lt; 3`, meaning that the result of the first comparison (`1 &lt; x`) is then compared to `3`. This can lead to unexpected results if the operator order and parentheses are not carefully considered. Another important aspect of evaluation is the distinction between `None` and `nan` (Not a Number). While `None` evaluates to false in boolean expressions, `nan` does not. Additionally, `nan` is different in every given case, never equal to itself.">evaluation</a> results in computer memory.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-variable">What is a variable?</h5>
<p>A <strong>variable</strong> is a named place where you can store a value to access it later. Imagine a box where you keep something. That's a variable.</p>
<p>For example, you calculate a result and would like to reuse this result elsewhere. In this case, you can use such a box to save time.</p>
<p>In general, it's a good practice to give a variable a name that describes its content.</p>
<h5 id="defining-a-variable-and-assigning-values">Defining a variable and assigning values</h5>
<p>You can keep almost anything in variables by assigning a value to a named variable with an equal sign. By <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PEP 8</a>, one space before and after the assignment sign is considered good practice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Monday"</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a string value <code class="language-python">"Monday"</code> stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a variable name is a unique identifier given to a variable, which is used to refer to a memory location where a value is stored. | Naming variables carefully is essential for writing clear and understandable code, as programmers often need to read and comprehend code written by others. Python's style guide, PEP 8, provides rules for naming variables, such as using lowercase letters with underscores separating words, and avoiding reserved words. Additionally, it is a best practice to choose variable names that accurately reflect their purpose and usage in the code.">variable name</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Monday</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-python">day_of_week</code> stores a value of the <code class="language-python">str</code> type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(type(day_of_week))  # </code></pre>
<p>You can always assign a new value to a defined variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Tuesday"</code></pre>
<p>Now, you will retrieve another value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 10
b = a  # b is 10</code></pre>
<p>If you haven't defined a variable within the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of a variable within the code. | When a variable is defined, it can be either global or local. A global variable is defined at the top level of the module and can be accessed from any code block in the program, making it useful for sharing state information or configuration between different functions. Local variables, on the other hand, are only visible within the nearest scope and cannot be accessed from the outside. The keyword 'global' is used to declare a variable as global, meaning it can be accessed and modified from within a function. By default, variables created inside a function are local and cannot be accessed from outside the function.">scope</a> of your code, you'll see an error when you try to use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined</code></pre>
<p>Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable. Let's assign the string name of a month to a variable and print its type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">month = "December"
print(type(month))  # </code></pre>
<p>Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">month = 12
print(type(month))  # </code></pre>
<p>This assignment works because Python is a language with <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, dynamic typing is a feature where the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile-time. | This means that the type of a variable can change throughout the execution of a program. For example, you can store an integer in a variable, and then later store a string in the same variable. This is different from statically typed languages, where the type of a variable is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program. It is important to note that while Python is dynamically typed, it is also strongly typed, meaning that variables cannot change type accidentally. However, it is still possible to explicitly convert variables from one type to another using type casting.">dynamic typing</a>.</strong></p>

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>Please, do not overuse dynamic typing! If your code is long, you might forget that you changed the type of a variable. This is a common reason for errors!</p>

<h5 id="naming-rules">Naming rules</h5>
<p>As mentioned above, each variable has a name that distinguishes it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables that you should follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Names are case-sensitive (<code class="language-python">month</code> is not the same as <code class="language-python">Month</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits or underscores (e.g., <code class="language-python">user_name</code>, <code class="language-python">score1</code>, <code class="language-python">_count</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A name cannot start with a digit (for example, <code class="language-python">2q</code> is invalid).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A name must not be a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f45ef5edabb1cc0748f3326e7114b8aaa0424392/Lib/keyword.py#L18" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a>keyword.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Do not break these rules; otherwise, your program will not work.</p>
