# Start by taking an integer input from the user

n = int(input())

# Now you need to calculate the cube of the given integer. The cube of a number can be calculated 
# by multiplying the number by itself twice. In Python, we can write it as: number * number * number

n_cube = n * n * n

# After getting the cube, assign it to a variable.

# Finally, print the calculated cube of the given integer using the print function.

print(str(n_cube))
