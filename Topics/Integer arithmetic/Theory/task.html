<p>In real life, we often perform <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed on numerical values. | Python supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operations</a>. They help us to calculate the change from a purchase, determine the area of a room, count the number of people in a line, and so on. The same operations are used in programs.</p>

<p>The examples below show how it works for numbers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(10 + 10)   # 20
print(100 - 10)  # 90
print(10 * 10)   # 100

<p>Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(2 + 2 * 2)  # 6</code></pre>
<p>The calculation order coincides with the rules of arithmetic operations. Multiplication has a higher priority level than addition and subtraction, so the operation <code class="language-python">2 * 2</code> is calculated first.</p>
<p>To specify an order of execution, you can use <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Firstly, they can be used with logical and arithmetic operators to ensure the correct order of evaluation. | Parentheses can also be used to create tuples, which are immutable data structures in Python.

Additionally, parentheses can be used to call functions, where the function name is followed by parentheses to indicate that the function is being called to get the result.">parentheses</a>,</strong> as in the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print((2 + 2) * 2)  # 8</code></pre>
<p>Like in arithmetic, parentheses can be nested inside each other. You can also use them for clarity.</p>
<p>The minus operator has a unary form that negates the value or expression. A positive number becomes negative, and a negative number becomes positive.</p>

<p><strong>The remainder of a division.</strong> Python modulo operator <code class="language-python">%</code> is used to get the remainder of a division. It may come in handy when you want to check if a number is even. When applied to some number and <code class="language-python">2</code>, it returns <code class="language-python">1</code> if the number is odd and <code class="language-python">0</code> if it's even.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(7 % 2)  # 1, because 7 is an odd number
print(8 % 2)  # 0, because 8 is an even number</code></pre>
<p>Here are some more examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Divide the number by itself
print(4 % 4)     # 0
# At least one number is a float
print(11 % 6.0)  # 5.0
# The first number is less than the divisor
print(55 % 77)   # 55
# With negative numbers, it preserves the divisor sign
print(-11 % 5)   # 4
print(11 % -5)   # -4</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Taking the remainder of the division by <code class="language-python">0</code> also leads to <code class="language-python">ZeroDivisionError</code>.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>The behavior of the mod function when two numbers have different signs might seem unexpected at first glance. Compare <code class="language-python">11 % 5 = 1</code> and <code class="language-python">-11 % -5 = -1</code> (both the dividend and the divisor have the same signs) with  <code class="language-python">11 % -5 = -4</code> and <code class="language-python">-11 % 5 = 4</code> (different signs).</p>
<p style="text-align: start;">To understand why it works that way we need to look under the "hood". In Python, the remainder always has the same sign as the divisor, and the modulo operator ( <code class="language-python">%</code>) and integer division (<code class="language-python">//</code>) are internally connected by the following expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x == (x // y) * y + (x % y)</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite it to get the "formula" for modulo division:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(x % y) == x - (x // y) * y</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's apply it to our examples. We want to calculate <code class="language-python">11 % -5</code>. First, we calculate <code class="language-python">11 // -5</code> and the result is <code class="language-python">-3</code>. Then we apply that to our formula and get <code class="language-python">11 % -5 == 11 - (-3) * (-5) == 11 - 15 == -4</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: start;">For <code class="language-python">-11 % 5</code> that looks like <code class="language-python">-11 % 5 == -11 - (-3) * 5</code> which equals <code class="language-python">4</code>. </p>
<p style="text-align: start;">If you want gain deeper understanding of this operation, you can check the topic <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/13541" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">"Modulo division with negative numbers"</a> from the Math section.</p>
<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, exponentiation is the operation of raising a number to a power, which means the base number is multiplied by itself a number of times equal to the exponent. | For example, 2 raised to the power of 3 would equal 8, since 2 is multiplied by itself 3 times. Exponentiation has a higher priority over other operations such as multiplication and division. In case where multiple operations have the same priority, Python follows a left-to-right operation convention. Exponentiation is a way to raise a number to a power, it has a higher priority over multiplication.">Exponentiation</a>.</strong> Here is a way to raise a number to a power:</p>

<h5 id="operation-priority">Operation priority</h5>
<p>To sum up, there is a list of priorities for all considered operations:</p>
<ol><li><p>power</p></li><li><p>unary minus </p></li><li><p>multiplication, division, and remainder</p></li><li><p>addition and subtraction</p></li></ol>
<p>As mentioned above, the unary minus changes the sign of its argument.</p>
<p>Sometimes operations have the same priority:</p>

<h5 id="pep-time">PEP time!</h5>
<p>There are a few things to mention about the use of binary operators (that is, the operators that influence both <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an operand is a value or variable on which an operation is performed. | In the context of the provided text, the operands are '3' and '5' in the expression '3 + 5', and the '+' sign is the operator. Operands can be of any data type, and the operation performed on them depends on the operator used. For example, arithmetic operators like '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), '\*' (multiplication), and '/' (division) take numerical operands, while comparison operators like '&lt;' (less than) and '&gt;' (greater than) take operands that can be compared based on some order.">operands</a>). As you know, readability does matter in Python. So first, remember to surround a binary operator with a single space on both sides:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">number=30+12      # No!

number = 30 + 12  # It's better this way</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Operators</strong> are special symbols indicating what operation to perform. <strong>Operands </strong>are values that the operation is performed on. Let's consider our example: <code class="language-python">30 + 12</code>. Here <code class="language-python">+</code> is an operator and <code class="language-python">30</code> and <code class="language-python">12</code> are operands.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Also, sometimes people use the break <strong>after </strong>binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>the operators are not in one column,  </p></li><li><p>each operator has moved away from its operand and onto the previous line:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># No: operators sit far away from their operands

          taxable_interest +
          (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
          ira_deduction -
          student_loan_interest)</code></pre>
<p>Mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention in order to solve the readability problem. Donald Knuth explains this in his <em>Computers and Typesetting</em> series: "Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations". Following this tradition makes the code more readable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Yes: easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
