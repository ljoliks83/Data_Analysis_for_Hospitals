<p>A real-world analogy of types is given by biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. For example, all dogs you've seen have the type <em>dog</em>, but each is an individual object. Thinking about a dog as a type, you can assume some operations are available. For example, a dog can bark.</p>
<p>In this topic, we will consider a few of the simplest data types commonly used in programming practice.</p>
<h5 id="strings">Strings</h5>
<p>Whenever you want to use textual information in your program, you'll have to work with <strong>strings</strong>. In Python, the string type is called <code class="language-python">str</code>. Strings are extremely common and useful. As discussed, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by a pair of single or double quotes. | There is no difference between the two, but there are conventions regarding their use. To include any quote in a string, you can use the backslash symbol () before the quote inside the string, which tells Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than the end or beginning of it. String literals can be used to represent textual information in a program, such as an email of a person or an organization.">string literals</a> may be delimited using either single or double quotes.</p>
<ul><li><p>Examples of strings in double quotes:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("")               # an empty string
print("string")         # one word
print("Hello, world!")  # a sentence</code></pre>
<ul><li><p>Examples of strings in single quotes:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('a')                   # a single character
print('1234')                # a sequence of digits
print('Bonjour, le monde!')  # a sentence</code></pre>
<p>In a real program, a string can represent an email of a person or an organization.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('hello@hyperskill.org')  # print an email</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, strings are very easy to use!</p>
<h5 id="numerical-types">Numerical types</h5>
<p>Numbers are essential for any programmer. You can hardly write any program without numbers, so let's discuss some basic <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numerical types are a category of data types that represent and handle numerical values. | They are further divided into several subtypes, including:

1. Integers: also known as ints, they represent whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. The term signed refers to the fact that the integer can be either positive or negative, as opposed to an unsigned integer which can only be positive or zero. Signed integers are used to count things in the real world. 2. Floats: they represent real numbers and have a decimal point. Floats are used to handle more precise numerical values that require decimal points. 3. Complex numbers: they are numbers with a real and imaginary component, denoted by a + bi. Each data object, such as a variable or a constant, has a type that describes how to store it in memory, which operations can be applied to this object, and how to execute these operations.">numerical types</a></strong>:</p>

<p>You can start working with a number by just printing it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(11)    # prints 11
print(11.0)  # prints 11.0</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code class="language-python">11</code> and <code class="language-python">11.0</code> are the same number, the former is an integer, and the latter is a float. The simplest way to distinguish them is by the decimal point. Floats have a <strong>decimal point</strong>, and integers don't. Pay attention!</p>
<p>You can also use negative numbers and zeros:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(0)      # prints 0
print(-5)     # prints -5
print(-1.03)  # prints -1.03</code></pre>
<p>Integer numbers can count things in the real world, while floating-point numbers are a good choice for statistical and scientific calculations.</p>
<h5 id="printing-types">Printing types</h5>
<p>We also have a way to demonstrate the types of different objects: use the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function, which is part of Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(type('hello'))  # 
print(type("world"))  # 

print(type(100))      # 
print(type(-50))      # 

print(type(3.14))     # 
print(type(-0.5))     # </code></pre>
<p>As you can see from the examples above, the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function indicates the data type of a passed value after the word <em>class</em>.</p>

<p>We hope you now have some intuition about <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines how it is stored in memory, what operations can be performed on it, and how those operations are executed. | It is similar to a biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects.
