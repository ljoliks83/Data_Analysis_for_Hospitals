<p>Programs in which there's nothing to calculate are quite rare. Therefore, learning to program with numbers is never a bad idea. An even more valuable skill we are about to learn is the processing of user data. With its help, you can create interactive and by far more flexible applications. So let's get started!</p>
<h5 id="reading-numbers-from-user-input" style="text-align: center;">Reading numbers from user input</h5>
<p>Since you have become familiar with the <code class="language-python">input()</code> function in Python, it's hardly new to you that any data passed to this function is treated as a <strong>string</strong>. But how should we deal with numerical values? As a general rule, they are explicitly converted to corresponding <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numerical types are a category of data types that represent and handle numerical values. | They are further divided into several subtypes, including:

1. Integers: also known as ints, they represent whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero. The term signed refers to the fact that the integer can be either positive or negative, as opposed to an unsigned integer which can only be positive or zero. Signed integers are used to count things in the real world. 2. Floats: they represent real numbers and have a decimal point. Floats are used to handle more precise numerical values that require decimal points. 3. Complex numbers: they are numbers with a real and imaginary component, denoted by a + bi. Each data object, such as a variable or a constant, has a type that describes how to store it in memory, which operations can be applied to this object, and how to execute these operations.">numerical types</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">integer = int(input())
floating_point = float(input())</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to current best practices: it's crucial not to name your variables as built-in types (say, <strong>float </strong>or <strong>int</strong>). Also, we should take into account user mistakes: if a user types an inaccurate input, say, a string '<samp>two</samp>' instead of a number <samp>2</samp>, a <code class="language-python">ValueError</code> will occur. At the moment, we won't focus on it; but don't worry, more information about errors is available in a dedicated topic. Now, consider a more detailed and pragmatic example of handling numerical inputs.</p>
<h5 id="free-air-miles" style="text-align: center;">Free air miles</h5>
<p>Imagine you have a credit card with a free air miles bonus program (or maybe you already have one). As a user, you are expected to input the amount of money you spend on average from this card per month. Let's assume that the bonus program gives you 2 free air miles for every dollar you spend. Here's a simple program to figure out when you can travel somewhere for free:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># the average amount of money per month
money = int(input("How much money do you spend per month: "))

# the number of miles per unit of money
n_miles = 2

# earned miles
miles_per_month = money * n_miles

# the distance between London and Paris
distance = 215

# how many months do you need to get
# a free trip from London to Paris and back
print(distance * 2 / miles_per_month)</code></pre>
<p>This program will calculate how many months it takes to travel the selected distance and back.</p>

<h5 id="advanced-forms-of-assignment" style="text-align: center;">Advanced forms of assignment</h5>
<p>Whenever you use an equal sign <code class="language-python">=</code>, you actually assign some value to a variable. For that reason, <code class="language-python">=</code> is typically referred to as an <strong>assignment operator</strong>. Meanwhile, there are other assignment operators you can use in Python. They are also called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a compound assignment operator is a shorthand notation for performing arithmetic operations and assignment in a single step. | It combines standard arithmetic operations with the assignment operator (=), such as +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=, and \*\*. These operators work by updating the value of the variable on the left side based on the operation and the value on the right. For example, in the expression 'x += 3', the value of 'x' is incremented by 3. This is a more advanced form of assignment that can simplify code and make it more readable.">compound assignment operators</a></strong>, for they carry out an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed on numerical values. | Python supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operation</a> and assignment in one step. Have a look at the code snippet below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># simple assignment
number = 10
number = number + 1  # 11</code></pre>
<p>This code is equivalent to the following one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># compound assignment
number = 10
number += 1  # 11</code></pre>
<p>One can clearly see from the example that the second piece of code is more concise (for it doesn't repeat the variable's name).</p>
<p>Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations: <code class="language-python">-=</code>, <code class="language-python">*=</code>, <code class="language-python">/=</code>, <code class="language-python">//=</code>, <code class="language-python">%=</code>, <code class="language-python">**=</code>. Given the opportunity, use them to save time and effort.</p>
<p>One possible application of compound assignment comes next.</p>
<h5 id="counter-variable" style="text-align: center;">Counter variable</h5>
<p>In programming, there is a concept called <em>loop</em>. It is used to repeat some <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a block of code refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Proper indentation is crucial for the block of code to work correctly. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> a certain number of times. Pretty often they have special variables called <strong>counters </strong>alongside them. A <strong>counter</strong>, as the name presupposes,<strong> </strong>counts something: how many times a condition is met, how many elements in the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a sequence is a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a particular order. | It includes lists, tuples, and strings. Sequences are characterized by their ability to be indexed, sliced, and iterated over. Indexing allows you to access individual elements of the sequence by their position, slicing allows you to extract a subset of the sequence, and iteration allows you to loop through the elements of the sequence. Additionally, sequences are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.">sequence</a>, etc. Hence, counters should be integers. Now we are getting to the point: you can use the operators <code class="language-python">+=</code> and <code class="language-python">-=</code> to increase or decrease the counter respectively.</p>
<p>Consider this example where a user determines the value by which the counter is increased:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">counter = 1
step = int(input())  # let it be 3
counter += step
print(counter)  # it should be 4</code></pre>
<p>In case you need only non-negative integers from the user (we are increasing the counter after all!), you can prevent incorrect inputs by using the <code class="language-python">abs()</code> function. It is a Python built-in function that returns the absolute value of a number (that is, value regardless of its sign). Let's readjust our last program a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">counter = 1
step = abs(int(input()))  # user types -3
counter += step
print(counter)  # it's still 4</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, thanks to the <code class="language-python">abs()</code> function we got a positive number.</p>
